      <h2>Journey Into Green</h2>

    <p>
      I was born and raised in Florida and still live in my hometown today. Being here for 25 years of my life has made the buildings, trees, and roads 
      as well-known to me as my own reflection. The few neighborhood woods that grew nearby as a kid made me feel just as home as the house I grew up in, 
      and maybe that's when my fascination in nature began to blossom. The peace and wonder is what captivated me, at an age where the world was still
      filled with so many mysteries. Neighbors barely batted an eye as us youngsters lugged tools like machetes, hatchets, and clippers to the woods to
      fashion ourselves a fort and weapons to fight off our imagined attackers (wooden weapons were better than machetes to us apparently).
